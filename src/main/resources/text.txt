Hello guys, curation is one of my passion and so is reading. I read a lot,
here in Medium, On Reddit, On HackerNews, and in general other places on the Internet.
While reading so many articles I have noticed one thing that sometimes a good article doesn't’t
get the exposure it deserves and when I see that I feel for them.
It takes a lot of hard work, time, and patience to write an article and there is nothing more frustrating
to find that only a handful of your friends have read it.
Java Community has given so much love to me, and I am really grateful I felt that I
should also do something for new writers and bloggers and Java developers who write and that’s why I have created this
Medium Publication, Javarevisited.
